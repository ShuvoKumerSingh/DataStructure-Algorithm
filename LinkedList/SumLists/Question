You have two numbers represnted by a lnked list, where each node contains a single digit. The digits are storedin reverse order, such that 1's digit is at the head of the
list. Write a function that adds the two numbers and returns the sum as  a linked list.

Example:
listA = 7->1->6
listB = 5->9->2

newLinkedList = 2->1->9
